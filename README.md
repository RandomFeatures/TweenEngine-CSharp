# TweenEngine-CSharp

This is a port of Aurelien Ribon amazing Universal Tween Engine to C#
I did the port back in 2012 and it has not been maintained. I found the Universal Tween Engine to be very useful in my Android games. 
So when I started picking up C# again I decided to port/recreate it just incase I decided to make more games.
